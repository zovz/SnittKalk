* Add image of dark mode to extension page
* Add Grade distribution barchart (weighted and not weigted)
* Make the sort switch darker for dark mode
* Fix extra "*" in extension page description
* The Average Grade Over time chart shows the y-axis as "Total Credits". This is wrong, and should be fixed
